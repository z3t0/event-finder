* event-finder

This is a script I wrote for SCESoc. The role of the script is to find events related to engineering and computing.

** Setup
Python 3.6+ is required to run this script

1. Install virtualenv
2. Create a virtual environment
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
virtualenv .venv
   #+END_SRC
3. Enter API tokens by copying secrets_template.json to secrets.json and editing appropriately
4. Enter the environment
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   source ./venv/bin/activate
   #+END_SRC
5. Install dependencies
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   #+END_SRC
6. Run the program
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    python event-finder.py address distance output
    #+END_SRC
    
Where:
- address: the physical address such as "Ottawa" or "1220 Merivale Road"
- distance: the distance in km such as "100km"
- output: the file where the data will be written to, as JSON
